## Example Entry

### Topic: Quantum Entanglement
**Date:** 2024-11-11

**What I learned:**
- Entanglement is about correlations, not communication
- Bell's theorem rules out local hidden variables
- The measurement problem is still unsolved

**Questions that arose:**
- How exactly does measurement "choose" an outcome?
- Is there a physical mechanism for collapse, or is it just how we should think about it?
- Why can't we use entanglement for FTL communication?

**Connections:**
- Relates to interference - both involve superposition
- Key resource for quantum computing algorithms
- Central to quantum cryptography security

**Analogies that help:**
- Not like Bertlmann's socks (pre-existing properties)
- More like a coin that doesn't have a value until you look
- But somehow "knows" to be correlated with distant partner
