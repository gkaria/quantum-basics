# Quantum Basics

A personal journey through quantum physics, quantum mechanics, and quantum computing. This repository focuses on building intuition and theoretical understanding of quantum phenomena, with special emphasis on quantum entanglement and interference.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized to gradually build understanding from fundamental concepts to more sophisticated quantum phenomena:

## Philosophy

This repository emphasizes:
- **Intuition over formalism** - Understanding *why* before *how*
- **Visual thinking** - Using analogies and mental models
- **Conceptual clarity** - Building from first principles
- **Wonder** - Maintaining the sense of awe at quantum phenomena

## Getting Started

1. Start with **[How to Start](./beginner/how-to-start.md)** to get your roadmap
2. Build foundations with **[Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals](./beginner/quantum-mechanics-fundamentals.md)**
3. Explore topics that fascinate you - particularly entanglement and interference!
